                            In high school I worked at a chicken farm on a part-time basis, collecting, stacking, grading, and cleaning eggs. This edified my life at the time with lessons on working with others in a more professional setting, and consistent attendance of said job.

                            This is a program that I created using python to intergrate the front-end library of tkinter, in python with the graphics library, turtle. It allows for users to use an interface that was created using  tkinter to input variables into simple singular movements (e.g. a sinle line, dot circle etcetera.) or a pattern that would repeat for a specified amount of times.

                            I, in collusion with two other students, worked together to complete a group project for the subject Rapid web application development (IAB107). This project tasked us with creating a web application using python, its flask library and git as a CI/CD system.  This allowed for me to learn amongst other things how to use a repository in collusion with others. <br> The task itself was to  create a web application using flask in python. The application that we made was an event planner themed around the university(QUT).

                            In this project I collaborated with 3 other students to develop a meal planner web application using java. The application was developed in the jetbrains IntelliJ IDE, and used a springleaf framework. I was in charge of the backend of the web-application, which used a mariaDB database, with SQL commands that were executed from several of the objects.

The wesite is created using plain html with css using bootstrap for its grids alongside some javascript. It was created as a curiculum vitae and a place for me to record my completed projects.
